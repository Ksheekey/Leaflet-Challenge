# Leaflet-Challenge

Here I set the points of the last 7 days of earthquakes.

the circles on the map show where the quake happened

the size of the circle indicates the magnitude of the occurence. The larger the circle the larger the Magnitude.

the color of the circles indicate the depth of the occurence. The darker the color the more depth, with red being the highest. There is a legend on the bottom left that instructs as so.

you can zoom out of the map to see all the quakes, there are plenty outside of the given start area.

This map will update with any new occurences, all you have to do is refresh the page and if there were any new pieces of data it will show on the map!

Thank you.
